# The Asaurus Game Engine

## Cloning
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, as Asaurus isn't testet in other development environments. Furthermore, Asaurus current focus is only on Windows Build so far.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Logstor/Asaurus`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
